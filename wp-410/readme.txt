Sends HTTP 410 (Gone) responses for deleted content, telling search engines the page is permanently removed.

== Description ==

This plugin issues an HTTP `410` response for URLs corresponding to content that has been permanently removed from your site. Originally created by Samir Shah, now maintained by Matt Calvert. When a post or page is deleted, the plugin logs the old URL and returns a `410` response when that URL is requested. You can also manually manage the list of obsolete URLs.

The [HTTP Specification](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.11) defines the `410 Gone` response for resources that have been permanently removed. It informs search engines and crawlers that the content will not return, improving crawl efficiency and SEO clarity.

This plugin is actively maintained by Matt Calvert as a personal project, informed by previous professional experience with similar 410-handling logic. No proprietary or employer-owned code has been used.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I customise the 410 response message? =

The default message is a simple plain text message that reads "Sorry, the page you requested has been permanently removed." This is because many people want to minimise the bandwidth that is used by error responses.

If you want to customise the message, just place a template file called `410.php` in your theme folder, and the plugin will automatically use that instead. Take a look at your theme's `404.php` file to see how the template needs to be structured. You can also hook into the `mclv_410_response` action to trigger any specific events for queries resulting in a 410 response.

= Will this plugin work if a caching/performance plugin is active ? =

The plugin has been tested with the following caching plugins, and should work even if they are active:

- W3 Total Cache
- WP Super Cache

I have not tested it with other caching plugins, and there is a high chance that it **will not work** with many of them. Most of them will cache the response as if it is a 404 (page not found) response, and issue a 404 response header instead of a 410 response header.

== Changelog ==

= 1.1.0 =
* **New:** Added WP-CLI commands for managing 410 URLs from the command line.
* **New:** `wp mclv-410 list` or `wp mclv-410 show` - List all 410 and 404 entries.
* **New:** `wp mclv-410 add <url>` - Add URLs manually from CLI (supports wildcards with *).
* **New:** `wp mclv-410 purge-404s` - Clear all logged 404 entries.

* **New:** `wp mclv-410 clear-test-data` - Remove test data.
* **New:** `wp mclv-410 test` - All-in-one test command (seed, list, cleanup).
* **New:** `wp mclv-410 dev-test` - Developer HTTP self-test that performs actual HTTP requests to verify 410 responses.
* Made `get_links()`, `get_404s()`, `add_link()`, `remove_link()`, `is_valid_url()`, and `purge_404s()` public for CLI access.

= 1.0.1 =
* **Bugfix:** Fixed array assignment typo in `note_inserted_post()` method (changed `[] .=` to `[] =`).
* **Bugfix:** Added defensive check for missing/invalid post objects to prevent errors when `get_post()` returns null.

= 1.0.0 =
* **New:** Wildcard patterns now displayed in a separate section with visual warning for better visibility.
